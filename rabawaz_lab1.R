#part 1

#Caenorhabditis elegans is the first multicelar organism that had its whole genome sequenced
#and its has similar feature or charatertistic as human.It is such an impoartant organism , 
#as many developmental and gentical experiments are direcly not possible to implement on human and they
#are very time consuming and coslty. So we can use that organ to do significant experiement in lab by 
#Scientific community.
